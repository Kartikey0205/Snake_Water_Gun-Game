This game is basically played in a childhood and it is interesting also when 2 players sits and enjoy their free time by playing this game . Imfact sometimes elder one too play this game now a days for mood fresh . Hope you will enjoy this Game.


There are total 2 players - one is computer itself(Automatic player) and other is you .<br>
Total 10 chances are given in each match.
# Criteria/condition of winning match are-
  
   If we show Snake and other is showing gun then assume that snake will be shot by gun so the player who select Gun wins the chance and score 1 points.
   If we show Snake and other is showing water then assume that snake will drink that water so the player who select snake wins the chance and score 1 points.
   If we show Gun and other is showing water then assume that Gun will sink in that water so the player who select water wins the chance and score 1 points.
   ........ etc etc , doesnot disclose each process because then the curiosity will be less .
